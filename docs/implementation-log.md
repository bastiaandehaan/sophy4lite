# Implementation Log

## Decision History and Implementation Notes

### 2024-09-04: AI-Driven Development Workflow Setup

#### Decisions Made:
- **CLAUDE.md**: Created comprehensive workflow documentation
- **Directory Structure**: Added docs/ and templates/ directories
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Fixed test imports and parameters
- **Documentation Standards**: Established coding and architecture standards

#### Technical Changes:
- Fixed test imports from `backtest.mtf_exec` to `backtest.mtf_exec_fast`
- Updated MTFParams usage to match actual implementation
- Resolved function signature mismatches in tests
- All 11 tests now passing successfully

#### Architecture Notes:
- Framework uses vectorized backtesting for performance
- Multi-timeframe confluence strategy is the primary focus
- FTMO compliance integrated throughout
- Look-ahead bias prevention is critical requirement

### Future Implementation Notes:
- Document major architectural decisions here
- Record performance optimization choices
- Track API changes and their impacts
- Note integration challenges and solutions

### Template Usage:
This log should be updated for each significant implementation session to maintain historical context and decision rationale.
